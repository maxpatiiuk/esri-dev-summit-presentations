### [ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript: App Development with Components, Part 2: Using Frameworks](./2026/using-components-2)

[![ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript: App Development with Components, Part 2: Using Frameworks header slide](2026/using-components-2/assets/header-slide.avif)](./2026/using-components-2)

[Slides and Demos](./2026/using-components-2)

Join us for the second technical session in a four-part series on building
applications with the ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript. Speakers begin with
exploring motivations for using front-end frameworks and then cover techniques
for integrating the SDK's web components with frameworks and tools such as React
and Vite. The session touches on current front-end methodologies for topics such
as dependency management, asset management, semantic versioning, prebuilt versus
built applications that scale, and conveniences offered by frameworks that
streamline web mapping app development compared to plain JavaScript.

### [ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript: Using Vite for Building Fast, Dynamic Web Apps](./2026/build-tooling)

[![ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript: Using Vite for Building Fast, Dynamic Web Apps header slide](2026/build-tooling/assets/header-slide.avif)](./2026/build-tooling)

[Slides and Demos](./2026/build-tooling)

This technical session explores a case study on how Esri's development teams are
leveraging modern tools like Vite to build fast, dynamic web GIS applications.
With features such as lazy loading, client-side routing, hot module replacement,
and lightning-fast builds, Vite streamlines the entire development workflow from
bundling to deployment. Paired with Vitest for testing, these tools help ensure
that your apps are both high-performing and production-ready.

### [ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript and 3D GIS Visualization: A Developer's Guide Beyond 2D Cartography](./2026/vis-techniques-3d)

[![ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript and 3D GIS Visualization: A Developer's Guide Beyond 2D Cartography header slide](2026/vis-techniques-3d/public/header-slide.avif)](./2026/vis-techniques-3d)

Discover how ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript unlocks powerful 3D visualization on
the web. This technical session dives into symbol types, visual variables, and
cartographic techniques unique to 3D, showing how to transform 2D features into
rich thematic 3D views. Through live demonstrations, see how to work with key 3D
data layers—including Indexed 3D Scene (I3S), integrated mesh, and building
scene layers—and learn best practices to create compelling, interactive
experiences that bring your GIS data to life.

Come to this technical session to discover the engineering infrastructure that
powers the ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript. We will focus on two key topics:

Get an inside look at Esri’s largest monorepo. We will demonstrate how we
structure our codebase to allow a dozen teams to collaborate, build, and deploy
from a single repository.

Learn how we manage and scale our supporting infrastructure and leverage
infrastructure-as-code and GitOps to enable GPU-based screenshot, performance
testing and more.
