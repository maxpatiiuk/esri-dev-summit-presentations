[Slides and Demos](./2025/using-components-2)

Join us for the second session in our three-part series on building applications
with the ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript. This session will begin with exploring
motivations for using frontend frameworks, and then will cover techniques for
integrating the SDK's web components with frameworks and tools such as React and
Vite. We will touch on current frontend methodologies for topics such as
dependency management, asset management, semantic versioning, and conveniences
offered by frameworks that streamline web mapping application development
compared to plain JavaScript.

[Slides and Demos](./2025/build-tooling)

Learn how Esri's development teams are leveraging modern tools like Vite to
build fast, dynamic Web GIS applications. With features such as lazy loading,
client-side routing, hot module replacement, and lightning-fast builds, Vite
streamlines the entire development workflow from bundling to deployment. Paired
with Vitest for testing, these tools help ensure that your apps are both
high-performing and production-ready.
