# Agenda

- Introduction to build tools
- Building an app
  - Get started with Vite
  - Add dependencies
  - Use TypeScript and ESLint
  - Publish the app
- Enhance the app
  - Lazy load parts of the application
  - Add tests with Vitest
  - Add custom plugins

<!--
Quick tour of app building...based on what Esri teams are doing
-->

# What are build tools?

Build tools transform the code that is easiest for developers to write into code that is most performant for the browser to run.

```mermaid
%%{init: {'flowchart': {'nodeSpacing': 25 }}}%%

graph LR
  subgraph human_files["Human-readable files"]
    direction LR
    TS[TypeScript .ts/.tsx]
    JS[JavaScript .js/.jsx]
    CSS[CSS/Sass .css/.scss]
    IMG[Assets .jpg/.json]
  end

  Bundler("Bundler")

  subgraph optimized_output["Browser-optimized output"]
    direction LR
    O_JS[Optimized JavaScript]
    O_CSS[Optimized CSS]
    O_IMG[Optimized Images]
  end

  human_files ==> Bundler ==> optimized_output
```

# Build tool benefits

- Improve development experience (live updates...)
- Enable modern syntax features and dependencies
- Make testing code simpler
- Optimize performance (reduce file sizes, split bundles...)
- Allow extending capabilities with plugins


---

# Examples of build tools

* Vite
* Parcel
* Webpack

---

# Vite

- Most popular build tool today
- Used by many Esri teams
- Great developer experience
- Large and rapidly growing community

# Demo: [Get started with Vite](https://github.com/maxpatiiuk/esri-dev-summit-presentations/tree/main/2025/build-tooling/demo/1-javascript)


<!--
- Create a Vite starter project
- Start the dev server and show how simple it is to use
- Show index.html, main.js, Splash.js, package.json
  - Similar to no-build-step apps
- Show live update
-->


---

## React

- As app grows, it benefits from more structure
- The most popular JavaScript library for building dynamic user-interfaces
- Build anything out of small Components
- JSX (JavaScript Syntax Extension).
  - `return <h1>Hello World! üëã</h1>;`
  - JavaScript code in HTML-like syntax

# Demo: [Add basic React 19](https://github.com/maxpatiiuk/esri-dev-summit-presentations/tree/main/2025/build-tooling/demo/2-react)


---

# Calcite Design System

- Library of 50 reusable web components
- Provides consistent and accessible UI out of the box
- Works with any framework


---

# ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript

- The most powerful Web GIS mapping library
- Now simpler to use than ever thanks to web components


---

# Demo: [Add Calcite and JS Maps SDK components](https://github.com/maxpatiiuk/esri-dev-summit-presentations/tree/main/2025/build-tooling/demo/3-web-components)

## TypeScript

Most developers see great benefit from adding TypeScript to their projects:

> TypeScript: catch your bugs before your users do

- Auto-magically ‚ú® provides better autocomplete and inline documentation
- Helps with code refactoring
- Encourages self-documenting code
- Essential part of every ArcGIS Online app at Esri


<!--
That's a lot of promises - lets see TypeScript in action by adding it to our
project.
-->


---
layout: center
---

# Demo: [Adopt TypeScript](https://github.com/maxpatiiuk/esri-dev-summit-presentations/tree/main/2025/build-tooling/demo/4-typescript)


---

# ESLint

- Optional, but very helpful on projects with multiple developers
- Enforce consistent code style on your team
- Catch some issues that TypeScript can't (like bad coding patterns)
- Autofix some issues for you


---
layout: center
---

# Demo: [Use ESLint](https://github.com/maxpatiiuk/esri-dev-summit-presentations/tree/main/2025/build-tooling/demo/5-eslint)


---

# Publishing

- You learned Vite, React, Calcite, Map Components, TypeScript, ESLint - now what?
- Let's publish the app!

<!--
That's it for the main tools Esri teams use to build their apps
Now comes the question - how do you get your app out there?
-->

---

# Demo: Publishing the app

Do a production build:

```sh
npm run build
```

Outputs static files that can be published to any hosting provider (GitHub
Pages, Vercel) or local server (NGINX, Microsoft IIS, Apache)

<!--
- The output is index.html and static files - same as no-build-step apps
  - Show off single minified JavaScript file
- Can be deployed to any hosting provider (GitHub Pages, Vercel) or local server (NGINX, Microsoft IIS, Apache)
-->

# Fun fact

These slides are built with Vite and hosted on GitHub Pages! ‚ú®

(with help from [Slidev](https://sli.dev/))

# Demo summaries

- **Vite ‚ö°** simplifies the development workflow
- **React ‚öõÔ∏è** makes it easy to do complex things in a maintainable way
- **Calcite üíé** provides ready to use user interface components
- **TypeScript ü¶æ** catches your bugs before your users do
- **ESLint üö©** ensures the code style stays consistent

# Enhance the app

---

# Lazy loading

* Only load source files when needed
* Split app into multiple entry points
* Simplest split: by page or route

---
layout: center
---

# Demo: [Lazy loading & routes with React Router](https://github.com/maxpatiiuk/esri-dev-summit-presentations/tree/main/2025/build-tooling/demo/6-routes)

---

# Testing

Testing is great, Vitest is also great!
* Fast with familiar API
* Supports modern language features
* Run tests in Node or the browser
* Direct integration with Vite

---

# Demo: [Add tests with Vitest](https://github.com/maxpatiiuk/esri-dev-summit-presentations/tree/main/2025/build-tooling/demo/7-tests)


---

# Custom plugins

* Vite plugins are flexible and easy to write
* Powerful way to enhance builds or developer workflows

# Demo: [Add custom plugins](https://github.com/maxpatiiuk/esri-dev-summit-presentations/tree/main/2025/build-tooling/demo/8-plugins)

---

# Demo summaries

- **Lazy loading üöÄ** improves app performance
- **Testing with Vitest üß™** makes it easy to write and maintain tests
- **Custom plugins üîå** provides a powerful way to enhance workflows

---

# In conclusion...

- Build tools like Vite help your app grow and stay maintainable
- They offer plenty of control and developer experience enhancements
- They pair well with testing tools like Vitest to ensure your app is production-ready
