# Map components Vite sample

## Get started

The project was created using [`npm create vite`](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) with the [vanilla JavaScript template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-vanilla).

Run `npm install` and then start adding modules.

For a list of all available `npm` commands see `scripts` in `package.json`, e.g. `npm run build`.
