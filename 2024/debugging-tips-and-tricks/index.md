## Code Editor

- VS Code
  - Syntax highlighting 🏳️‍🌈
  - Code Hinting 💬
  - Git integration 🌳
  - Theming 😎
  - Task integration ⛑️

> speaker notes:
>
> (Noah) As a developer, you would be spending a lot of time in the code editor,
> so picking the right one and configuring it to your liking can save you hours
> down the road.
>
> If you already know which code editor or IDE you prefer, that is awesome! If
> you are just getting started and aren't sure, VS Code is a great choice.
>
> Lets look at some useful tools that a good editor provides: (read the slide)

## Code Editor: Prettier

![Prettier takes care of formatting code consistently automatically. Before Prettier, you might have an unformatted HTML code snippet with inconsistent spacing and alignment](./demos/prettier/prettier-pre.webp)

▼

![After running Prettier, the same HTML code snippet is now uniformly formatted with consistent spacing and alignment](./demos/prettier/prettier-post.webp)

> speaker notes:
>
> (Noah) The most helpful tool for improving developer productivity, is a code
> formatter. Prettier is the most popular choice and comes installed by default
> in many editors. If you have a formatter configured to run on save, you can
> write code without worrying about formatting, and Prettier will take care of
> making the code look good for you.
>
> Take a look at these before and after images to show how much clear formatting
> helps, and Prettier can do that for you automatically.

## Code Editor: ESLint

![](./demos/eslint/eslint.webp)

> speaker notes:
>
> (Noah) Code Quality becomes very important as the project grows. Good code is
> hard to define, but in general it makes it easier for your teammates and the
> future you to understand what the code is doing, and to make modifications as
> necessary.
>
> ESLint is a popular choice for enforcing code quality. It's like having an
> experienced developer behind your back, reviewing every line you type, giving
> you advice and mentoring you on how to improve the code.
>
> In this small example, ESLint suggests we define our variable as "const"
> rather than "let" given that we don't modify it anywhere else in the code.
> Later, ESLint also notices that we are comparing the variable to itself, which
> is a potential bug.

## Code Editor: Live reload

VS Code extensions:

- Browser Lite
- LiveServer
- entire Edge browser with DevTools inside of VS Code

> speaker notes:
>
> TODO: these tools serve a similar purpose, but with different levels of
> complexity. Should we simplify to mention just one? Edge browser inside of VS
> Code is definitely the most powerful, though also more complex to setup.
>
> (Noah) While developing your app, you probably are making a lot of small
> changes, checking if the app works, and changing things again if it doesn't.
> Normally, you would have to reload the page after every change to see the
> effect, but there are several tools that can apply your changes as soon as you
> typed them, without reloading the page - that saves a lot of time.
>
> There are several VS Code extensions for that, as well as command line
> utilities. On this slide you can see 3 recommended extensions.

## Code Editor: Git

VS Code extensions: GitLens, Github Pull Requests & Issues

![](./assets/gitlens.webp)

> speaker notes:
>
> (Noah) Whether you are working alone, or in a group of developers, tracking
> the code changes is important as that makes it easy to see who changed what,
> when, and why. It also makes it easy to roll back changes if something goes
> wrong. And even more importantly, it prevents you from accidentally loosing
> your work.
>
> Git is the most popular version control system, paired with GitHub for hosting
> Git repositories. However, using Git from the command line is not the most
> approachable for beginners. Fortunately, VS Code comes with two great
> extensions for Git built in.
>
> The image on this slide shows GitLens in action. It visualizes the recent Git
> commit history, and summarizes the changes from you and your peers.

## TypeScript

> TypeScript: catch your bugs before your users do

- Helps with refactoring
- Self-documenting code
- Better autocomplete

> speaker notes:
>
> (Max) As soon as you start working on a larger application, you will find
> TypeScript very helpful for keeping the app maintainable. It's a superset of
> JavaScript that introduces type-safety into the code.
>
> This helps with catching typos and other errors before the user does. It also
> makes refactoring apps much easier as TypeScript will point out if a new
> feature you added requires code changes in other parts of the app.
>
> Finally, TypeScript gives the editor more understanding of how your app works,
> which in turns makes for much better autocomplete when typing.
>
> ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript has quick start guides for TypeScript, as well
> as sample apps

## DevTools

> Debugging tools === Productive programmers

- Breakpoints 🔴
- Network Traffic 🌐
- Console 📃
- CSS inspection 💎
- and much more! 🛠️

> speaker notes:
>
> (Max) Each browser ships with extremely powerful debugging and inspector
> tools. These should be developer's best friend as they help you diagnose even
> complex issues quickly.
>
> Browser based tools allow you to debug the application, inspect page styles,
> monitor network traffic, test accessibility and many more. In the next section
> of this presentation we will go over some of the most important capabilities
> of DevTools.

## Debugging: Breakpoints

- Various ways to pause code
- `debugger;`
- Blackboxing (from context menu)
- stop on (un)caught exceptions

## Debugging: Philosophy

Narrow down the issue:

- App specific
- API specific
- Server-side issue
- Are any 3rd party resources involved?

When debugging, isolate the issue to smaller and smaller reproducible case until
figured out what is the cause

- Is the problem with how the code is written?
- Is the issue on the client (API) or server?
- Is there a performance issue?
- Is the issue with the data?

![](https://hgonzago.github.io/tips-tricks-webinar/images/onion.jpg)

Use version control like Git, and make regular small commits to see a history of
changes. This also allows to see what needs to be rolled back if things broke
suddenly.

require(['esri/geometry/support/webMercatorUtils'], function (
  webMercatorUtils,
) {
  var extent = this.view.extent;
  var geoExtent = webMercatorUtils.webMercatorToGeographic(extent);
  console.log(JSON.stringify(geoExtent));
});
```

## Maps SDK Resources

[![Maps SDK Resources](https://hgonzago.github.io/DevSummit-presentations/Dev-Summit-2018/Dev-debug-tips/images/jsapiResources.png)](https://github.com/Esri/jsapi-resources)

- TypeScript definition file
- Build tools, e.g. Webpack
- OAuth Callback

> speaker notes:

> (Max)

## Good practices

- Check Maps SDK release notes
- Update to new version regularly
- Use GitHub Dependabot to receive alerts of new versions and security fixes
- Write Unit tests and other types of tests for your code - will give you
  confidence that changes to the app in one place didn't break something else

> speaker notes:
>
> (Max) A few final words of advice:
>
> - We introduce many cool features with every Maps SDK release, and you don't
>   want to miss out on them. So update to the newest version regularly and
>   check the release notes for each version.
> - For apps that deal with sensitive data, it's especially important to keep
>   all dependencies of your project up to date. Security vulnerabilities are
>   discovered and fixed all the time, and it's hard to keep up with all of
>   them. Fortunately, GitHub has a tool called Dependabot that updates your
>   dependencies automatically and opens a Pull Request for you to review.
> - Finally, as soon as your app is more than a single page, changes in one part
>   of the app could have unexpected consequences on a different page. Verifying
>   that everything works correctly in every possibly scenario is very time
>   consuming and error prone. That is why it's an industry best practice to
>   write automated tests for your applications. These could be as simple as
>   making sure your function does some computation correctly, to some as
>   complex as clicking though your app with a virtual mouse, while taking
>   screenshots in the process and comparing them to the expected result.
