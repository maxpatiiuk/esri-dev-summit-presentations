## Overview

- React
- TypeScript
- Calcite
- ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript

## React

JavaScript library for building user-interfaces

- Virtual DOM (Document Object Model)
  - Copy of real DOM
  - If there's a change, VDOM will update, compare differences between the real
    DOM and virtual DOM, then only the part of the DOM that is changed will
    update, rather than the entire DOM
- JSX (JavaScript Syntax Extension)
  - JavaScript code in HTML-like syntax
- One-way data binding
  - Data is transferred from top to bottom

## TypeScript

Javascript with syntax for types

- Open-source programming language developed by Microsoft
- Superset of JavaScript
- Add types to data such as: strings, booleans, numbers, etc.
- Helps with code management
- Throws errors allowing developers to catch issues earlier on in development
- [TypeScript setup](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/guide/typescript-setup/)
  - Use TypeScript to catch typos, have better autocomplete, and build more
    maintainable apps

## Calcite Design System

- 50+ Web Components (Custom Elements), 2000+ icons, color schemes, design
  tokens
  - Ready to use & reuse
- Built with Stencil.js
  - Compiler that generates Web Components (Custom Elements)
  - Uses TypeScript, JSX, and CSS (SASS also available)
- Documentation
  - Getting started
  - Gallery
  - Samples
  - CSS Variables
    - Supported feature in modern CSS, unrelated to Calcite Components and Web
      Components
- Calcite Components React

> Calcite Design System is a set of reusable web components with implementation
> guidance that can be used to build on-brand and accessible web applications.
> Along with web components it includes a UI kit, icons, and color schemes.
>
> Calcite Components are framework-agnostic, so it can web components built with
> StencilJS. Stencil is a compiler that generates custom elements using
> TypeScript, JSX, and CSS.
>
> Calcite Components React is a wrapper for calcite components. When using with
> TypeScript it gives you type safety. The reason why you would use this instead
> of using calcite components directly is that custom events are connected for
> you instead of having to access the Dom node and adding event listeners to a
> ref.

## Calcite Design System: Benefits

- Consistent UX; consistent brand identity
- Clear direction for designers and developers; follows best practices
- Reduce effort & cost; speed up updates
- Improve accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA); comply with web-standards

## ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript

Empower your web apps with geospatial web technology

- Features include, but aren't limited to:
  - Portal set up
  - Load and display geographic information in 2D and 3D
  - Out-of-the-box widgets
  - Create custom widgets with Widget Development Framework
- Written in TypeScript
- Install and set up
  - CDN
  - ESM
- [Maps SDK Resources](https://github.com/Esri/jsapi-resources)
  - [React sample app](https://github.com/Esri/jsapi-resources/tree/main/esm-samples/jsapi-react)
  - [TypeScript sample app](https://github.com/Esri/jsapi-resources/tree/main/esm-samples/jsapi-vite-ts)

> speaker notes:
>
> ArcGIS API for JS is a web API that allows users to create apps that unlock
> your data’s potential with interactive user experiences. The Portal API allows
> developers to work with users, groups, and content that’s hosted within ArcGIS
> Online or ArcGIS Enterprise.
>
> There’s also out-of-the-box widgets that developers can use to enrich their
> user’s experience. Along with that developers can use the Widget class to
> create new widgets or repurpose existing ones.
>
> There are different ways to set it up but for this project we are going to use
> the ES modules build.

## Good practice

- Check Maps SDK release notes
- Update to new version regularly
- Learn your tools ([DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/),
  IDE) well
- Use GitHub Dependabot to receive alerts of new versions and security fixes
- Write Unit tests and other types of tests for your code - will give you
  confidence that changes to the app in one place didn't break something else

## Development Environment Setup

Installation:

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
npm install @esri/calcite-components-react
npm install @arcgis/core
npm install ncp
```

Add copy script and build scripts:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "npm run copy && vite",
    "build": "npm run copy && vite build",
    "copy": "ncp node_modules/@esri/calcite-components/dist/calcite/assets/* ./public/assets/"
  },
```

> speaker notes:
>
> To start, create the app using the React builder of your choice. For this
> example here, we’re using create-react-app and starting off with the
> TypeScript template.
>
> Next, install calcite-components-react. We don’t need to install
> calcite-components because it’s a dependency of this package.
>
> Install the ES module build of ArcGIS API for JS
>
> And finally, install ncp. We'll use that to copy the assets over. This allows
> icon to show and the date picker to be properly translated.

## Layout + Feature

TODO: what kind of app are we looking to build? (Purpose, Features,
Functionality)

> Highlight differences between Calcite Components and Calcite Components React.
> Why should React Apps use Calcite Components React instead?

## Adding Custom Widgets to the View

> speaker notes:
>
> Demonstrate usage of Calcite Components within React Components and showcase
