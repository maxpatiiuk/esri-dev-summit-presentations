Impressions:

- Before the session, make sure to have everything opened and located
  conveniently
- Zoom in to increase font size, console size, window size (maybe change display
  settings to reduce pixel size - will make everything look larger)
- Create separate VS Code profile for presenting - larger font size, less noise,

Material:

- Suggest using ChatGPT today. Also VS Code Chat, and "Explain this error" ahead
  of time and everything setup
- Link to other sessions worth seeing (both this year and past years)
- ESLint flat config, Calcite rules
- Prettier!!!
- suggest people check release notes. Update regularly. Use dependabot?
- Web-component specific debugging (i.e shadow dom)
  - The Properties tab in devtools
- Use TypeScript to catch typos, and have better autocomplete, and maintainable
  apps - would be useful down the line too

Ideas:

- Consider leaving footnotes with more links on each slide for people to go over
  afterward (or in spate file, but they may be too lazy to open that)
- Embed lots of small videos in slides so that don't have to do as many things
  live?
- Have slides url at the bottom of each slide?

## TODOs

- [ ] Brainstorm things that were't shown in recent years, but would still be
      useful to both new and intermediate developers
- [ ] Go over repositories and slides from previous years more and see what can
      be reused or improved
- [ ] How do we switch between displays when presenting? one person has slides
      and another demos? or all from single laptop?
